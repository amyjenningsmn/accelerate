/**
 * Accelerate Marketing Child functions and definitions
 *
 * Set up the theme and provides some helper functions, which are used in the
 * theme as custom template tags. Others are attached to action and filter
 * hooks in WordPress to change core functionality.
 *
 * When using a child theme you can override certain functions (those wrapped
 * in a function_exists() call) by defining them first in your child theme's
 * functions.php file. The child theme's functions.php file is included before
 * the parent theme's file, so the child theme functions would be used.
 *

 *
 * Functions that are not pluggable (not wrapped in function_exists()) are
 * instead attached to a filter or action hook.

// note: sometimes this doesn't work, and to fix it, The easiest way to fix this is to have WordPress reset the permalinks. So, I will go to the Settings menu and click on Permalinks.
// I will then change the permalinks setting from Day and Name to Month and Name, although it really doesnâ€™t matter which one I choose.
// I will then hit Save Changes, and then I will go back to my test case study and hit refresh. And, sure enough, there it is.
